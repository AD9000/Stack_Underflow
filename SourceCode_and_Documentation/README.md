# Source Code + Documentation

This is where we separate the frontend and backend into two parts.  
Since both of them are independent, they can be run in separate docker containers for maximum decoupling.  
However, they are in the same repository for convenience purposes for the purpose of this assignment. Once we go to production however they will be maintained in different repositories.

For more detail on each of them check out:

- [frontend/README](frontend/README.md)
- [backend/README](backend/README.md)
